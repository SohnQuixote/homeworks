reversi is the game that player_1 and player_2 can play together on the 8*8 board, to import this board game in to program,
I should divide this game's procedure into small pieces. this game should print the initial value on the board first. and 
check whether the stone can be put down on the board or board is full if board is full, calculate p1's stone and p2's stone 
to determine who is winner of the game. and also unless stone can pe put down, other player's turn be called.
in each player's turn, program should check if stone can be put down on that coordinate. if it can, change the other's 
stone by the rule. print the changed board again. p1's turn and p2's turn will be reapeted untill game finished.
to be more exactly, each player's turn includes check the board, check the coordinate from player, check coordinate is good or
not, check the area surrounding player's coordinate, and change stone by the rule , print the changed board. board will be 8*8 
int array and p1's stone is 1 p2's stone is 2. in checking the surrounding area, program will move the same direction if other stone 
is detected. if his stone is detected or there is no stone program will stop recursion. and also change the other stone if only his stone is
detected during the journey.
